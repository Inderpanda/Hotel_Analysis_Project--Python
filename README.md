- Data Import and Exploration
  
The data analysis process begins with Data Import and Exploration. This involves importing datasets using Pandas, understanding the structure and content of each dataset, and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a preliminary sense of the data.

- Data Cleaning
  
Next is Data Cleaning, where the focus is on handling missing values, ensuring consistency in data types, and addressing any data quality issues identified during the exploration phase.

- Data Transformation
  
Following cleaning, Data Transformation is carried out. This step includes merging dimension and fact tables for a comprehensive analysis, creating new features if necessary, and preparing the data by aggregating and transforming it to fit analytical needs.

- Analysis Insights
  
Finally, in the Analysis Insights phase, Pandasâ€™ groupby and merge functions are utilized to uncover valuable insights. This analysis includes examining booking trends, revenue patterns, and expense distributions, identifying key drivers of business performance, and providing actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.
